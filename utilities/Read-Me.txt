Note:

The files to make svg sprite are relocated to this path

~\utilities\svg-sprite

The gulp file at this path "~\utilities\svg-sprite" is use to generate SVG sprite as explained in the screen cast.


The gulp file in the root directory is used to minify CSS and Javascript.


The paths described in the screen cast are not valid now but the procedure to make svg sprite is same.
