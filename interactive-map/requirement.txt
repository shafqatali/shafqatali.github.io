So, we have a new csv and a group of folder with filenames 10xx.jpg and without the file count column

You want from me to add a new column to csv as filecount

And rename all filenames to 0.jpg, 1.jpg etc

When my csv is ready, I will send it to you and:


b) You will create the new index.html for langID = 1 , so I can duplicate it and create another one for langID = 2






-------------- Done
a) You will convert it to json (and please show my how, because I tried to use a convert tool and it has a lot of options)
c) The slide in effect remain the same
d) If the image has multiple images it will have the 360 effect and an autoplay icon
e) If the image is single it will just show one (but I think if you keep the 360 here it just won't show any movement so it will be ok)
f) If the images are below (let's say) 5, can it show any next/previous button for slider effects? It can be global setting too.
