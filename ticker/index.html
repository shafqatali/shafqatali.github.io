<p>So, annoyingly, most JS solutions don't do horizontal tickers on an infinite loop, nor do they render all that smoothly.</p>
<p>The difficulty with CSS was getting the animation to transform the entire items 100% yet include an offset that was only the width of the browser (and not the items full width).</p>
<p>Setting the start of the animation to anything less than zero (e.g. -100%) is unreliable as it is based on the items width, and may not offset the full width of the browser or creates too large an offset</p>
<p>Padding left on the wrapper allows us the correct initial offset, but you still get a 'jump' as it then loops too soon. (The full text does not travel off-screen)</p>
<p>This is where adding display:inline-block to the item parent, where the natural behaviour of the element exists as inline, gives an opportunity to add padding-right 100% here. The padding is taken from the parent (as its treated as inline) which usefully is the wrapper width.</p>
<p><b>Magically*</b> we now have perfect 100% offset, a true 100% translate (width of items) and enough padding in the element to ensure all items leave the screen before it repeats! (width of browser)</p>
<p>*Why this works: The inside of an inline-block is formatted as a block box, and the element itself is formatted as an atomic inline-level box. <br>Uses `box-sizing: content-box`<br>
    Padding is calculated on the width of the containing box.<br>
    So as both the ticker and the items are formatted as nested inline, the padding must be calculated by the ticker wrap.</p>
